# Game of Life

This is a polars plugin to show and explore some of the things one can achieve by writing plugins.

Polars (and DataFrames in general) were not made for this - it's just a proof of concept.

For an example of life running in a dataframe, [see `run.py`](run.py):

```bash
python run.py -i input/input03.txt -d 0.02
```
